GScripts
=========

Personal game play scripts for various games on computer.

AQ doesn't allow JS injection or it's insta-ban so I utilized a bash script to automate based on timing of actions instead.

IW is scripted with Sikuli, a hybrid scripting program that utilizes both python as well as OCR. The primary script is used mainly to cycle through other players' bosses so I can level up.

PK scripts were written both with au3 and Sikuli scripts. PK is a mobile game and at the time my phone couldn't handle scripts, so the tradeoff was to run these scripts on BlueStacks on a laptop while I studied or something. I had to create backup au3 click scripts due to Sikuli's image searching causing my laptop to overheat.
